## About the Dataset
_The dataset is used to predict a categorical variable of Yes and No where the categories are encoded to be 1 (for Yes) and 0 (for No). This is to use the variable Age and Estimated Salary as the predictors. It contains 400 observations_

## Case Scenario
Your company where you work as a data scientist just released a new brand of furniture, and your role is to predict which of your customers can purchased the product. The result will help the advertising team target thr right customers that will buy the new product.

## Model used
This model uses the K-Nearesr Neighbors to carryout the prediction.

## Python codes for K-NN Model

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
```

```python
dataset = pd.read_csv('Social_Network_Ads.csv')
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values
```

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 0)
```

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.transform(X_test)
```

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
classifier = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 5, metric = 'minkowski', p = 2)
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Predicting a new result

```python
print(classifier.predict(sc.transform([[30,87000]])))
```

### Predicting the Test set results
```python
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
print(np.concatenate((y_pred.reshape(len(y_pred),1), y_test.reshape(len(y_test),1)),1))
```

### Making the Confusion Matrix
```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print(cm)
accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
```

### Notes:
_In Logistics regression, the regression curve was a straight line dividing the category, but in K-NN, it is a curve. Not so smoth a curve_
